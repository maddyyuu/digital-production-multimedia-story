    <p id="story">Closing out the 68th Annual Grammy Awards, Bad Bunny claimed Album of the Year for Debí Tirar Más Fotos, 
        making history as the first entirely Spanish-language record to receive the Recording Academy’s 
        top honor.</p>

    <p id="story">
        Accepting the award primarily in Spanish, the Puerto Rican artist used the moment to honor his roots and his community, 
        dedicating the win to “all the people who had to leave their home, their land, their country, to follow their dreams.”</p>
        
    <p id="story">
        The moment marked a career-defining milestone for the Puerto Rican superstar and emphasized a broader shift in Latin music’s 
        presence within the global mainstream, just one week before his highly anticipated Super Bowl Halftime Show performance.</p>

        Translated as “I should have taken more photos,” Debí Tirar Más Fotos is Bad Bunny’s sixth solo album and a heartfelt love letter 
        to Puerto Rico. Both deeply personal and resonant, the album invites listeners to reconnect with their roots in a way that 
        transcends language barriers, weaving
        <span class="soundcite" 
        data-url="badbunny.mp3" 
        data-plays="1">traditional Puerto Rican music</span> including bomba, salsa, and plena 
        with modern reggaeton, denbow, pop, and more.</p>
    
    <p id="story">
        Released on January 5, 2025, the album gained global momentum, propelled by singles like the title track “DtMf,” 
        which dominated Billboard’s global charts. Beyond its commercial success, Debí Tirar Más Fotos weaves in poignant social commentary, 
        touching on themes of loss, gentrification, immigration, and cultural heritage. For instance, the opening track, “NUEVAYoL,” 
        reflects on Puerto Rican life in New York City and the broader diaspora, while the album comes full circle with “La MuDANZA,”
        whose
